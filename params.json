There is currently no functionality for\r\nwriting OFX data to a file.\r\n\r\nUse the wrapper in the following way:\r\n\r\n(ns mypackage.core\r\n  (require '[ofx-clj.core :as ofx]))\r\n\r\n; get the entire OFX file as a map\r\n(def data (ofx/parse \"/path/to/data.ofx\"))\r\n\r\n; get all the banking messages from the map\r\n(ofx/find-all-transactions data \"banking\")\r\n\r\nTwo sample OFX files are included in the \"resources\" directory.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nCopyright (C) 2012 Himanshu Rathod\r\n\r\nDistributed under the Eclipse Public License, the same as Clojure.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
